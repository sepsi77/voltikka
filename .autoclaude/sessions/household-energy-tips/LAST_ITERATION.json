Here's a summary:\n\n## Session Complete: `household-energy-tips`\n\n### What was accomplished:\n\n1. **Added flexible time-range calculation methods** to SpotPrice.php:\n   - `findCheapestHoursInRange()` - finds cheapest hours within a time window\n   - `findMostExpensiveHourInRange()` - finds most expensive hour in range\n   - Both handle midnight-crossing ranges (e.g., 22:00-06:00)\n\n2. **Fixed sauna calculator** to only consider evening hours (17:00-22:00)\n\n3. **Added new household appliance calculators**:\n   - **Laundry** (07:00-22:00): 2h @ 2kW, daytime for noise consideration\n   - **Dishwasher** (18:00-08:00): 2h @ 1.5kW, overnight with delay start\n   - **Water heater** (24h): 1h @ 2.5kW, timer-controlled, anytime\n\n4. **Redesigned the UI** with a unified \"Kodin energiavinkit\" (Home energy tips) section:\n   - Consistent coral design system\n   - Each card shows: icon, activity name, time constraints, recommended time, cost, and savings\n   - Responsive 3-col",
