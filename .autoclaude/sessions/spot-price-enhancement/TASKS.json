The tooltip should appear centered above the hovered segment, not at a fixed position. Calculate position based on the segment's actual coordinates (use the path's center point based on hour angle). Update the showTooltip function to position tooltip correctly near the hovered segment.",

Each quarter should show: time label (05:00-05:15), a small horizontal bar proportional to its price, and the price value. The bars should use the same color coding (green/yellow/orange/red) as the hourly bars. Current quarter should be highlighted with orange. This makes visual comparison much faster than reading numbers.",
