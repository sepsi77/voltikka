# Video Art Direction Skills

## Purpose
This skill teaches how to be a thoughtful **art director** for animated videos — making intentional decisions about pacing, visual hierarchy, motion, and storytelling that turn boring content into engaging experiences.

## Core Principle: Every Frame Earns Attention

Viewers decide in milliseconds whether to keep watching. Your job is to:
1. **Reward attention** — always give them something worth looking at
2. **Guide the eye** — make it obvious what matters right now
3. **Create rhythm** — vary the pace so it feels alive, not mechanical
4. **Respect their time** — dense with value, zero filler

## Video Type Frameworks

Not all videos tell the same kind of story. Match your structure to your purpose.

### Type A: Promotional Videos (Persuasion)

**Goal**: Move viewer from unaware → interested → ready to act

**Structure: The 5-Beat Narrative**

| Beat | Duration | Purpose | Visual Energy |
|------|----------|---------|---------------|
| **Hook** | 2-3 sec | Stop the scroll, create curiosity | HIGH — bold, unexpected, moving |
| **Problem** | 3-5 sec | "Yes, that's my situation" | TENSE — visual friction, disorder |
| **Solution** | 5-7 sec | Introduce product as the bridge | RELIEF — clarity emerges |
| **Proof** | 5-7 sec | Concrete benefit, demo, social proof | CONFIDENT — smooth, assured |
| **CTA** | 3-5 sec | Single clear action | FOCUSED — clean, direct |

**Emotional arc**: Curiosity → Recognition → Hope → Trust → Action

---

### Type B: Informational Videos (Utility)

**Goal**: Deliver value quickly, build habit of returning

This is for your **spot price updates**, market summaries, daily briefings — content people check regularly for practical value.

**Structure: The Glanceable Update**

| Section | Duration | Purpose | Visual Approach |
|---------|----------|---------|-----------------|
| **Identifier** | 1-2 sec | "This is today's update" | Brand moment, date/time stamp |
| **Headline** | 2-3 sec | The single most important takeaway | BIG, unmissable, the "tweet" version |
| **Details** | 5-10 sec | Supporting data, breakdown | Organized, scannable, layered reveal |
| **Action insight** | 3-5 sec | "What should I do with this info?" | Practical, specific recommendations |
| **Sign-off** | 1-2 sec | Consistent ending, builds familiarity | Quick, branded, repeatable |

**Key differences from promotional**:
- **Front-load the value** — assume they might leave after 5 seconds, make those 5 seconds worth it
- **Consistency builds trust** — same structure daily lets viewers pattern-match and find info faster
- **Data is the star** — visuals serve the information, not the other way around
- **Actionable > Interesting** — "prices spike at 6pm" beats "fascinating price patterns"

**Emotional arc**: Recognition → Understanding → Clarity → Confidence

---

### Type B Example: Spot Price Update Video

**0-2 sec: Identifier**
- Logo + "Today's Electricity Prices" + Date
- Quick, familiar, no suspense needed

**2-5 sec: Headline**
- "Cheap morning, expensive evening" or "Great day to run heavy appliances"
- This is the "if they only see one thing" moment
- Visual: dominant text, supporting price range graphic

**5-12 sec: Details**
- Hour-by-hour or time-block breakdown
- Highlight the extremes (cheapest window, most expensive window)
- Use color coding consistently (green = cheap, red = expensive)
- Reveal progressively, don't dump everything at once

**12-17 sec: Action Insight**
- "Best time for sauna: 2-4 PM"
- "Charge your EV before 5 PM"
- "Avoid heavy usage 6-8 PM"
- Visual: icons for activities + recommended time windows

**17-20 sec: Sign-off**
- "Tomorrow's forecast: Similar pattern"
- Brand + "Updated daily at 7 AM"

---

### Type C: Educational Videos (Understanding)

**Goal**: Viewer learns something they didn't know before

**Structure: The Curiosity Loop**

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Question** | Pose something they've wondered about |
| **Misconception** | What most people assume (often wrong) |
| **Reveal** | The actual answer, with satisfying clarity |
| **Implication** | Why this matters to them |
| **Bookmark** | Memorable takeaway they can recall later |

---

## Visual Hierarchy Principles

### 1. One Focus Per Moment

The viewer's eye should never wander asking "where should I look?"

**Establish hierarchy through**:
- **Size**: Important things are bigger
- **Contrast**: Important things pop from background
- **Motion**: The moving thing gets attention (use sparingly)
- **Isolation**: Whitespace around important elements
- **Position**: Center and upper areas read first

**Anti-pattern**: Multiple elements competing for attention simultaneously. If everything is bold, nothing is bold.

### 2. Progressive Disclosure

Don't show everything at once. Layer information:

1. **Primary**: The one thing they must see (headline, key number)
2. **Secondary**: Supporting context (appears after primary lands)
3. **Tertiary**: Details for those still watching (breakdown, fine print)

Each layer earns the right to appear by the previous layer being absorbed.

### 3. Consistent Visual Language

Across all your videos, maintain:
- **Color meaning**: If green = cheap in one video, it always means cheap
- **Spatial patterns**: If time flows left-to-right, always left-to-right
- **Typography hierarchy**: Same fonts, same size relationships
- **Motion signatures**: Your brand's "feel" of movement

Consistency lets returning viewers process faster — they learn your visual language.

## Motion Principles

### Motion Has Meaning

Every animation should answer: **"Why is this moving?"**

| Motion Type | Communicates | Use For |
|-------------|--------------|---------|
| **Enter from below** | Arriving, emerging | New information appearing |
| **Enter from side** | Sequence, flow | Next item in a series |
| **Scale up** | Importance, emphasis | Key numbers, headlines |
| **Scale down + fade** | Dismissal, done | Information leaving |
| **Bounce/overshoot** | Energy, playfulness | Celebrations, positive moments |
| **Shake** | Error, warning, attention | Alerts, negative emphasis |
| **Smooth drift** | Calm, ambient | Backgrounds, atmospheric elements |

### The Three Speeds

Vary your pacing using three distinct speeds:

1. **Snap** (fast, 0.2-0.4 sec): Quick cuts, rapid reveals, energetic moments
2. **Flow** (medium, 0.5-0.8 sec): Standard transitions, comfortable reading pace  
3. **Breathe** (slow, 1-2 sec): Important moments that need to land, emotional beats

A video that's all one speed feels monotonous. Alternate intentionally.

### Entrances vs Exits

**Entrances** deserve more attention than exits:
- Entrances: Slower, more expressive, often with overshoot
- Exits: Quicker, simpler, get out of the way

The new thing matters more than the old thing leaving.

### Stagger, Don't Synchronize

When multiple elements enter, stagger their timing slightly (100-200ms apart). Synchronized movement feels robotic; staggered movement feels organic.

Exception: Intentionally synchronized motion can emphasize unity or impact.

## Data Visualization for Video

### Principles for Animated Data

1. **Build, don't present**: Animate charts growing/filling rather than appearing complete
2. **Annotate the journey**: Add callouts at key moments ("Here's where prices spike")
3. **Compare explicitly**: If showing two things, animate the comparison (bars growing side-by-side)
4. **Land on the insight**: End state should clearly show the takeaway

### For Price/Time Data Specifically

**Effective patterns**:
- Timeline that fills/reveals left-to-right as time progresses
- Color gradient from green (cheap) to red (expensive) — intuitive, no legend needed
- "Now" marker that shows current position in day
- Highlighted windows for "best" and "worst" periods

**Avoid**:
- Too many data points at once (aggregate into time blocks)
- Requiring legend lookup to understand (color meaning should be obvious)
- Animation that obscures the data (flourish over function)

## Pacing & Rhythm

### Reading Time Reality

How long people need to absorb different elements:

| Element | Minimum Time |
|---------|--------------|
| Single word | 0.3 sec |
| Short phrase (3-5 words) | 1 sec |
| Sentence | 1.5-2 sec |
| Number with context | 1-1.5 sec |
| Chart/graph | 2-4 sec |
| Complex visual | 3-5 sec |

**Don't rush past your content.** If you show it, give time to read it.

### The Pause is Part of the Design

Strategic pauses:
- **After a key reveal**: Let it land (0.5-1 sec)
- **Before a transition**: Signal "that section is complete"
- **At emotional peaks**: Don't undercut impact with immediate motion

### Rhythm Patterns

**Steady pulse**: Consistent timing, predictable. Good for: lists, sequences, data series.

**Building momentum**: Each beat faster than the last. Good for: building to climax, creating urgency.

**Punctuated rhythm**: Regular beats with occasional holds. Good for: emphasizing certain items in a sequence.

## Color & Contrast

### Functional Color Palette

For informational videos especially, establish clear color meanings:

| Color | Meaning | Use |
|-------|---------|-----|
| Green spectrum | Good, cheap, recommended | Low prices, optimal times |
| Red spectrum | Caution, expensive, avoid | High prices, peak times |
| Blue spectrum | Neutral, informational | Standard data, context |
| Yellow/Gold | Highlight, attention | Key callouts, special emphasis |
| White | Primary content | Text, foreground elements |
| Dark values | Background, secondary | Containers, de-emphasized areas |

### Contrast Ratios

- **Hero text** (headlines, key numbers): Maximum contrast, punch off the background
- **Supporting text**: High contrast but not competing with hero
- **Tertiary info**: Lower contrast, recedes but remains readable
- **Disabled/inactive**: Distinctly muted

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### The "PowerPoint Problem"
Elements that simply appear and disappear. Every entrance and exit should have intentional motion, even if subtle.

### The "Demo Reel Problem"  
Over-animating everything. Motion should serve communication, not showcase animation skills. If an element doesn't need to move, it shouldn't.

### The "Wall of Text Problem"
Too many words on screen. Video is not a document. Chunk aggressively: one idea per moment.

### The "Mystery Meat Problem"
Viewer doesn't know what they're looking at. Always provide context: titles, labels, clear visual hierarchy.

### The "Constant Motion Problem"
Background elements that never stop moving become distracting noise. Ambient motion should be subtle and should pause during key moments.

### The "One Speed Problem"
Everything animates at the same duration. Vary timing to create rhythm and emphasis.

## Pre-Production Checklist

Before creating any video, answer:

1. **What type is this?** (Promotional / Informational / Educational)
2. **What's the one-sentence takeaway?** (If viewer remembers one thing)
3. **Who's watching and why?** (Context of viewing)
4. **What should they feel?** (Emotional target)
5. **What should they do after?** (Intended action)
6. **What's the visual star?** (Data, product, message, story)

---

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing any video:

- [ ] **First 2 seconds are strong** — would this stop a scroll?
- [ ] **Clear hierarchy at every moment** — never ambiguous where to look
- [ ] **Pace matches content** — breathing room for complex info, quick on simple
- [ ] **Motion has purpose** — nothing moves just to move
- [ ] **Consistent visual language** — colors, typography, motion feel unified
- [ ] **Readable timing** — everything on screen long enough to absorb
- [ ] **Strong ending** — clear conclusion, not just... stopping
- [ ] **Works without sound** — core message comes through visually
